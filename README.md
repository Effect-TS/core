## Performance
Currently we run only minor benchmarks in ci where we test against `@qio` and `waveguide` as they represent a similar feature-set, the benchmarks may be affected by environmental conditions and they are not necessarily a representation of the production performance where we can expect all those libraries to perform similarly.

Running on a dedicated VM free of load:
```
ma@instance-1:~/matechs-effect/packages/effect$ yarn bench
yarn run v1.22.4
$ yarn ts-node bench/index.ts && yarn ts-node bench/nestedMap.ts && yarn ts-node bench/nestedChain.ts

## Thanks

This library would have not been feasibly possible without the strong foundations of [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [Waveguide](https://github.com/rzeigler/waveguide) from which we have forked the base bifunctor and execution runtime, huge thanks to the Authors.

This library was initially based on Fluture, huge thanks to the Authors.

Another huge thanks goes to both the scala community (ZIO in specific) and the haskell community (RIO & Polysemy) from which inspiration is taken.

All of the above projects are advised!
