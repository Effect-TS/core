/**
 * When this effect represents acquisition of a resource (for example,

 * the acquisition is not interrupted and the resource is always released.
 *
 * The function does two things:
 *
 * 1. Ensures this effect, which acquires the resource, will not be
 * interrupted. Of course, acquisition may fail for internal reasons (an
 * uncaught exception).
 * 2. Ensures the `release` effect will not be interrupted, and will be
 * executed so long as this effect successfully acquires the resource.
 *
 * In between acquisition and release of the resource, the `use` effect is
 * executed.
 *
 * If the `release` effect fails, then the entire effect will fail even
 * if the `use` effect succeeds. If this fail-fast behavior is not desired,
 * errors produced by the `release` effect can be caught and ignored.
