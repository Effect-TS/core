 * Returns a new effect that performs the same operations as this effect, but

 *
 * Note that effects are interruptible by default, so this function only has
 * meaning if used within an uninterruptible region.
 *
 * WARNING: This operator "punches holes" into effects, allowing them to be
 * interrupted in unexpected places. Do not use this operator unless you know
 * exactly what you are doing. Instead, you should use `uninterruptibleMask`.
