 * Recovers from errors by accepting one effect to execute for the case of an
 * error, and one effect to execute for the case of success.
 *
 * This method has better performance than `either` since no intermediate
 * value is allocated and does not require subsequent calls to `flatMap` to
 * define the next effect.
 *
 * The error parameter of the returned `IO` may be chosen arbitrarily, since
 * it will depend on the `IO`s returned by the given continuations.
