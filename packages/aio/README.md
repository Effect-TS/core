# Deprecation

This package can be safely used only in backend environments where tree shaking is not a need as it both depends on non shakable libraries and uses an export structure that is non shakable without webpack 5+ and in general bundlers without DSA (Deep Scope Analysis)

# Notes

The best place to look for concrete usage are tests & demo folders of each package
