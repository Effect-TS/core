# Introduction
Matechs Effect is a typescript library inspired by scala's ZIO and Haskell's RIO architecture.

Docs at [https://mikearnaldi.github.io/matechs-effect/modules/_matechs_effect.html](https://mikearnaldi.github.io/matechs-effect/modules/_matechs_effect.html)

It aims to provide a strong foundational block to build typescript code in a more testable and standardized way.

This library is composed at its core by the `@matechs/effect` package that exposes 2 effects

- `type Effect<R, E, A> = (r: R) => Wave<E, A>`

The underlying `Wave` is provided by `Waveguide`.

You can think of this type as a computation that requires an environment `R` to run.

The module exposes 2 instances of the typeclass `type EffectMonad<T extends URIS3> = Monad3E<T> & MonadThrow3<T> & Bifunctor3<T>`:

- `effectMonad` for `Effect<R, E, A>`
- `concurrentEffectMonad` for `Effect<R, E, A>` provides concurrent `ap`

Pipeable functions are also exported for both instances (default `Effect`, `parAp`, `parApFirst`, `parApSecond` for parallel)

Interesting integrations and usage examples can be found in `packages/orm`, `packages/http`, `packages/rpc`, `packages/tracing`

## Details

For details about the additional types and overloads please refer to documentation in `packages/effect`

## Notes

This package is a work in progress syntax and functions might change, feedback are welcome and contributions even more!

The primary difference with waveguide itself is in how we manage the `R` parameter and in the utilities that we provide around environment management. The focus on this library is making environmental effects easy while providing valuable integrations out of the box where `Waveguide` itself poses primary focus around the underlying `Wave<E, A>`

## Ecosystem

- `@matechs/tracing` : provides integration with opentracing-js
- `@matechs/http` : provides integration with axios
- `@matechs/orm` : provides integration with typeorm
- `@matechs/rpc` : no boilerplate rpc for your effects
- `@matechs/express` : provides integration with express
- `@matechs/graceful` : utility to handle graceful exit

## Thanks

This library would have not been feasibly possible without the strong foundations of [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [Waveguide](https://github.com/rzeigler/waveguide) & huge thanks to the Authors.

Another huge thanks goes to both the scala community (ZIO in specific) and the haskell community (RIO & Polysemy) from which inspiration is taken.

All of the above projects are advised!
