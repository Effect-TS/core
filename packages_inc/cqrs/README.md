Provides a utility framework on top of `@matechs/orm` & `@matechs/morphic` to do CQRS with DDD.

This utility doesn't per se enforce an event sourcing model that we find too restrictive for most of the scenarios it instead take a less intrusive approach by providing you the primitives needed to store, orgnize and query events efficiently so you can use it where you see fit.
