/**
 * Fold a tree into a "summary" value in depth-first order.
 *
 * For each node in the tree, apply `f` to the `value` and the result of applying `f` to each `forest`.
 *
 * This is also known as the catamorphism on trees.
 *
 * @example
 * import { fold, make } from 'fp-ts/lib/Tree'
 *
 * const t = make(1, [make(2), make(3)])
 *
 * const sum = (as: Array<number>) => as.reduce((a, acc) => a + acc, 0)
 *
 * // Sum the values in a tree:
 * assert.deepStrictEqual(fold((a: number, bs: Array<number>) => a + sum(bs))(t), 6)
 *
 * // Find the maximum value in the tree:
 * assert.deepStrictEqual(fold((a: number, bs: Array<number>) => bs.reduce((b, acc) => Math.max(b, acc), a))(t), 3)
 *
 * // Count the number of leaves in the tree:
 * assert.deepStrictEqual(fold((_: number, bs: Array<number>) => (bs.length === 0 ? 1 : sum(bs)))(t), 2)
